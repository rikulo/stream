 * If a request handler finishes immediately, it doesn't have to return anything.

 *       final info = {"name": "Rikulo Stream", "version": connect.server.version};
 *       connect.response
 *         ..headers.contentType = contentTypes["json"]
 *         ..write(Json.stringify(info));
 *     }
 *
 * On the other hand, if a request is handled asynchronously, it *must* return
 * an instance of [Future] for indicating if the handling is completed. For example,
 *
 *     Future loadFile(HttpConnect connect) {
 *       final completer = new Completer();
 *       final res = connect.response;
 *       new File("some_file").openRead().listen((data) {res.writeBytes(data);},

 *         onError: (err) => completer.completeError(err));
 *       return completer.future;
 *     }
 *
 * As shown above, the error has to be *wired* to the Future object being returned.
 *
 * > The returned `Future` object can carry any type of objects. It is applications
 * specific. Stream server simply ignores it.
 *
 * > Though not specified, the handler can have any number of named arguments.
 * They are application specific. Stream server won't pass anything but the default
