abstract class StreamServer {
  /** Constructor.
   *
   * ##Request Handlers
   *
   * A request handler is responsible for handling a request. It is mapped
   * to particular URI patterns with [uriMapping].
   *
   * The first argument of a handler must be [HttpConnect]. It can have optional
   * arguments. If it renders the response, it doesn't need to return anything
   * (i.e., `void`). If not, it shall return an URI (which is a non-empty string,
   * starting with * `/`) that the request shall be forwarded to.
   *
   * ##WebSocket Handling
   * 
   * To handle WebSockets, you can prefix the URI mapping with `'ws:'`,
   * and then implement a WebSocket handler. A WebSocket handler has a
   * single argument and the argument type must be [WebSocket]. For example,
   *
   *     new StreamServer(uriMapping: {
   *       "ws:/foo": (WebSocket socket) {
   *         socket.listen((event) {
   *           //event is the message sent by the client
   *           //you can handle it and return a message by use of socket.add()
   *         });
   *         return socket.done;
   *       },
   *     }).start();
   *
   * Note: The `ws:` prefix in the mapping table maps both "ws://" and "wss://".
   * 
   * ##Arguments
   *
   * * [homeDir] - the home directory for holding static resources. If not specified,
   * it is the root directory of the application.
   * You can specify a relative path relative to the root
   * directory. For example, you can create a directory called `static` to hold
   * the static resources, and then specify `static` as the home directory.
   *     > The root directory is assumed to the parent directory of the `webapp`
   *     > directory if it exists. Otherwise, it is assumed to be the directory where
   *     > the `main` Dart file is. For example, if you execute `dart /foo1/myapp.dart`,
   *     > the root is assumed to be `/foo1`. On the other hand, if executing
   *     > `dart /foo2/webapp/myapp.dart`, then the root is `/foo2`.
   * * [uriMapping] - a map of URI mappings, `<String uri, RequestHandler handler>`
   * or `<String uri, String forwardURI>`.
   * The key is a regular expression used to match the request URI. If you can name
   * a group by prefix with a name, such as `'/dead-link(info:.*)'`.
   * The value can be the handler for handling the request, or another URI that this request
   * will be forwarded to. If the value is a URI and the key has named groups, the URI can
   * refer to the group with `(the_group_name)`.
   * For example: `'/dead-link(info:.*)': '/new-link(info)'`.
   * * [filterMapping] - a map of filter mapping, `<String uri, RequestFilter filter>`.
   * The key is a regular expression used to match the request URI.
   * The signature of a filter is `void foo(HttpConnect connect, void chain(HttpConnect conn))`.
   * * [errorMapping] - a map of error mapping. The key can be a number representing
   * the status code, e.g., 404 and 403.
   * The value can be an URI or a renderer function. The number is used to represent a status code,
   * such as 404 and 500.
   * **Trick**: You can use a special number to indicate a special case.
   * For example, in our sample app (features), we use -900 to denote
   * an exception that can be recovered.
   * **Trick**: You can also override ([DefaultRouter.getErrorHandler]) to
   * detect the type and return a proper handle it for it.
   * * [disableLog] - whether to disable logs.
   * If false (default), [Logger.root] will be set to [Level.INFO], and
   * a listener will be added [logger].

   * It will be removed before the URI mapping and  it is not visible to
   * the request handler. For example, you can generate the JavaScript link as

   *

   *
   * ##Typical Use
   *

   *
   *     server.uriVersionPrefix = "/$buildNumber";
   *
   * Then, the browser will reload the JavaScript code automatically each
   * time the build number is changed.
   *
   * You can prefix it to the image that depends on the build number too.
